Hippocampal theta sequences in REM sleep during spatial learning

Each point indicates a single putative theta sequence prior to our selection criteria, color coded according to line-fitting score (warmer colors indicating lower line-fitting score, while cooler colors indicating higher line-fitting score, see colorbar for values). Each point, when hovered over, shows a decoded sequence, with x axis indicating time, y axis indicating track space, and color indicating probability of decode in that time x space bin (saturated for visualization). Drop down menus toggle between line-fitting score and selected/non-selected sequence color maps (selected decodes in dark blue, and non-selected decodes in yellow), respectively. An optional alpha/opacity dropdown can be used to indicate/highlight selected/non-selected decodes (to highlight selected decodes, choose the options, Values = selected; Alpha = selected_alpha).
